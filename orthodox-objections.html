                <div class="topic-content">
                    <p>Catholic belief: The Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son (Filioque).</p>
                    <p>Orthodox objection: The Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father alone, as stated in the original Nicene Creed.</p>
                    <p>Catholic response: The Filioque clarifies the relationship within the Trinity and is implied in Scripture (John 15:26, 16:7). It doesn't change the monarchy of the Father but emphasizes the consubstantiality of the Son with the Father.</p>
                    <strong>Biblical Evidence:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>John 15:26: "When the Advocate comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth who comes from the Father, he will testify on my behalf."</li>
                        <li>John 16:7: "Nevertheless I tell you the truth: it is to your advantage that I go away, for if I do not go away, the Advocate will not come to you; but if I go, I will send him to you."</li>

                        <li>CCC 246: "The Latin tradition of the Creed confesses that the Spirit 'proceeds from the Father and the Son (filioque)'. The Council of Florence in 1438 explains: 'The Holy Spirit is eternally from Father and Son; He has his nature and subsistence at once (simul) from the Father and the Son. He proceeds eternally from both as from one principle and through one spiration.'"</li>

                <div class="topic-content">
                    <p>Catholic belief: The Pope, as successor to Peter, has universal jurisdiction over the entire Church.</p>
                    <p>Orthodox objection: The Bishop of Rome is "first among equals" but does not have authority over other patriarchs.</p>
                    <p>Catholic response: Christ gave Peter unique authority (Matthew 16:18-19), which continues in his successors. This ensures unity in the Church and was recognized in the early centuries, even by Eastern fathers.</p>
                    <strong>Biblical Evidence:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Matthew 16:18-19: "And I tell you, you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not prevail against it. I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven."</li>
                        <li>Luke 22:32: Jesus tells Peter, "I have prayed for you that your own faith may not fail; and you, when once you have turned back, strengthen your brothers."</li>

                    <p>Orthodox objection: The Pope should have a primacy of honor, not of jurisdiction.</p>
                    <p>Catholic response: Papal supremacy developed organically from Christ's commission to Peter and was exercised and recognized throughout Church history, including in the East before the schism.</p>
                    <strong>Biblical Evidence:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>John 21:15-17: Jesus tells Peter to "Feed my lambs... Tend my sheep... Feed my sheep," indicating a special pastoral role.</li>
                        <li>Acts 15: Peter plays a decisive role in the Council of Jerusalem.</li>

                <div class="topic-content">
                    <p>Catholic belief: Original sin is inherited, leaving human nature wounded and inclined to evil.</p>
                    <p>Orthodox objection: Humans inherit the consequences of Adam's sin (death, corruption) but not the guilt.</p>
                    <p>Catholic response: The Catholic view doesn't imply personal guilt for Adam's sin but recognizes a privation of grace affecting human nature. This explains the universal need for baptism, even for infants.</p>
                    <strong>Biblical Evidence:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Romans 5:12: "Therefore, just as sin came into the world through one man, and death came through sin, and so death spread to all because all have sinned."</li>
                        <li>Psalm 51:5: "Indeed, I was born guilty, a sinner when my mother conceived me."</li>

                        <li>CCC 404: "How did the sin of Adam become the sin of all his descendants? The whole human race is in Adam 'as one body of one man'. By this 'unity of the human race' all men are implicated in Adam's sin, as all are implicated in Christ's justice."</li>

                    <p>Catholic response: The Immaculate Conception preserves Mary's perfect holiness, fitting for the Mother of God. It's the ultimate application of Christ's saving work, anticipating the restoration of all humanity.</p>

                <div class="topic-content">
                    <p>Catholic belief: After death, those destined for heaven may undergo purification in purgatory.</p>
                    <p>Orthodox objection: While praying for the dead is practiced, the concept of purgatory as a distinct state or place is rejected.</p>
                    <p>Catholic response: Purgatory is a process of final sanctification, not a "third place" between heaven and hell. It's consistent with the Orthodox practice of praying for the dead and the belief in postmortem purification.</p>
                    <strong>Biblical Evidence:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>1 Corinthians 3:15: "If the work is burned up, the builder will suffer loss; the builder will be saved, but only as through fire."</li>
                        <li>2 Maccabees 12:44-45 (in Catholic canon): "For if he were not expecting that those who had fallen would rise again, it would have been superfluous and foolish to pray for the dead."</li>

                    <strong>Catechism of the Catholic Church (CCC):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>CCC 1030: "All who die in God's grace and friendship, but still imperfectly purified, are indeed assured of their eternal salvation; but after death they undergo purification, so as to achieve the holiness necessary to enter the joy of heaven."</li>

                    <p>Catholic belief: In the Latin Rite, unleavened bread is used for the Eucharist.</p>
                    <p>Orthodox objection: Leavened bread should be used, as it symbolizes the risen Christ.</p>
                    <p>Catholic response: Both traditions are valid. Unleavened bread connects the Eucharist with the Passover and emphasizes Christ's sinlessness. The Eastern Catholic Churches use leavened bread, showing the compatibility of both practices.</p>
                    <strong>Biblical Evidence:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Matthew 26:17-19: Jesus celebrates the Last Supper during the Feast of Unleavened Bread.</li>
                        <li>1 Corinthians 5:7-8: Paul refers to Christ as "our paschal lamb" and calls believers to celebrate with "the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth."</li>

                    <p>Catholic response: These views are complementary, not contradictory. The Catholic understanding includes both satisfaction and victory aspects, recognizing the multifaceted nature of Christ's saving work.</p>

                    <ul>

                    <p>Catholic response: The Gregorian calculation is more astronomically accurate. The difference in dates is a matter of calendar reform, not doctrine. Some Eastern Catholic Churches follow the Julian calculation for pastoral reasons.</p>

                <div class="topic-content">
                    <p>Catholic belief: Scholastic theology uses philosophical reasoning to understand divine revelation.</p>
                    <p>Orthodox objection: Theology should be more mystical and experiential, as in the Hesychast tradition.</p>
                    <p>Catholic response: Both approaches have value. Scholasticism doesn't replace mystical theology but complements it. The Catholic tradition includes both intellectual and mystical approaches to understanding God.</p>
