                <h3 class="topic-title">1. The Filioque Controversy</h3>
                <div class="topic-content">
                    <p>Catholic belief: The Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son (Filioque).</p>
                    <p>Orthodox objection: The Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father alone, as stated in the original Nicene Creed.</p>
                    <p>Catholic response: The Filioque clarifies the relationship within the Trinity and is implied in Scripture (John 15:26, 16:7). It doesn't change the monarchy of the Father but emphasizes the consubstantiality of the Son with the Father.</p>

                <h3 class="topic-title">2. The Primacy of Peter and the Role of the Pope</h3>
                <div class="topic-content">
                    <p>Catholic belief: The Pope, as successor to Peter, has universal jurisdiction over the entire Church.</p>
                    <p>Orthodox objection: The Bishop of Rome is "first among equals" but does not have authority over other patriarchs.</p>
                    <p>Catholic response: Christ gave Peter unique authority (Matthew 16:18-19), which continues in his successors. This ensures unity in the Church and was recognized in the early centuries, even by Eastern fathers.</p>
                </div>

            <div class="topic">
                <h3 class="topic-title">3. Papal Supremacy vs. Papal Primacy</h3>
                <div class="topic-content">
                    <p>Catholic belief: The Pope has full, supreme, and universal power over the whole Church.</p>
                    <p>Orthodox objection: The Pope should have a primacy of honor, not of jurisdiction.</p>
                    <p>Catholic response: Papal supremacy developed organically from Christ's commission to Peter and was exercised and recognized throughout Church history, including in the East before the schism.</p>

                <h3 class="topic-title">4. The Western vs. Eastern Understanding of Original Sin</h3>
                <div class="topic-content">
                    <p>Catholic belief: Original sin is inherited, leaving human nature wounded and inclined to evil.</p>
                    <p>Orthodox objection: Humans inherit the consequences of Adam's sin (death, corruption) but not the guilt.</p>
                    <p>Catholic response: The Catholic view doesn't imply personal guilt for Adam's sin but recognizes a privation of grace affecting human nature. This explains the universal need for baptism, even for infants.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="topic">
                <h3 class="topic-title">5. Immaculate Conception</h3>
                <div class="topic-content">
                    <p>Catholic belief: Mary was conceived without original sin and remained sinless throughout her life.</p>
                    <p>Orthodox objection: While Mary is highly venerated, she was born with ancestral sin like all humans.</p>
                    <p>Catholic response: The Immaculate Conception preserves Mary's perfect holiness, fitting for the Mother of God. It's the ultimate application of Christ's saving work, anticipating the restoration of all humanity.</p>

            <div class="topic">
                <h3 class="topic-title">6. Purgatory and Temporal Punishment</h3>
                <div class="topic-content">
                    <p>Catholic belief: After death, those destined for heaven may undergo purification in purgatory.</p>
                    <p>Orthodox objection: While praying for the dead is practiced, the concept of purgatory as a distinct state or place is rejected.</p>
                    <p>Catholic response: Purgatory is a process of final sanctification, not a "third place" between heaven and hell. It's consistent with the Orthodox practice of praying for the dead and the belief in postmortem purification.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="topic">
                <h3 class="topic-title">7. The Use of Unleavened Bread in the Eucharist</h3>
                <div class="topic-content">
                    <p>Catholic belief: In the Latin Rite, unleavened bread is used for the Eucharist.</p>
                    <p>Orthodox objection: Leavened bread should be used, as it symbolizes the risen Christ.</p>
                    <p>Catholic response: Both traditions are valid. Unleavened bread connects the Eucharist with the Passover and emphasizes Christ's sinlessness. The Eastern Catholic Churches use leavened bread, showing the compatibility of both practices.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="topic">
                <h3 class="topic-title">8. The Western View of Atonement</h3>
                <div class="topic-content">
                    <p>Catholic belief: Christ's death satisfies divine justice and reconciles humanity with God (Satisfaction Theory).</p>
                    <p>Orthodox objection: The focus should be on Christ's victory over death and the restoration of human nature (Christus Victor).</p>
                    <p>Catholic response: These views are complementary, not contradictory. The Catholic understanding includes both satisfaction and victory aspects, recognizing the multifaceted nature of Christ's saving work.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="topic">
                <h3 class="topic-title">9. The Date of Easter</h3>
                <div class="topic-content">
                    <p>Catholic belief: Easter is calculated using the Gregorian calendar.</p>
                    <p>Orthodox objection: Easter should be calculated using the Julian calendar, as was done in the early Church.</p>
                    <p>Catholic response: The Gregorian calculation is more astronomically accurate. The difference in dates is a matter of calendar reform, not doctrine. Some Eastern Catholic Churches follow the Julian calculation for pastoral reasons.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="topic">
                <h3 class="topic-title">10. The Role of Scholasticism vs. Hesychasm</h3>
                <div class="topic-content">
                    <p>Catholic belief: Scholastic theology uses philosophical reasoning to understand divine revelation.</p>
                    <p>Orthodox objection: Theology should be more mystical and experiential, as in the Hesychast tradition.</p>
                    <p>Catholic response: Both approaches have value. Scholasticism doesn't replace mystical theology but complements it. The Catholic tradition includes both intellectual and mystical approaches to understanding God.</p>
