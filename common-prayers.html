                        My God, I am sorry for my sins with all my heart. <br>
                        In choosing to do wrong and failing to do good,<br>
                        I have sinned against You, whom I should love above all things.<br>
                        I firmly intend, with Your help, to do penance, to sin no more, and to avoid whatever leads me to sin.<br>
                        Our Savior Jesus Christ suffered and died for us. In His name, my God, have mercy. Amen.

                    and forgive us our trespasses<br>
                    as we forgive those who trespass against us;<br>
                    and lead us not into temptation,<br>
