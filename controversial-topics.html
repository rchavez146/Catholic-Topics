                    <p>Controversy: This stance conflicts with growing societal acceptance of LGBTQ+ rights and same-sex marriage.</p>
                    <p>Catholic perspective: While upholding its teaching on sexual ethics, the Church emphasizes the dignity of all persons regardless of sexual orientation.

                    <p>Controversy: This position is at odds with widespread use and acceptance of contraception in modern society.</p>
                    <p>Catholic perspective: The Church teaches that contraception separates the unitive and procreative aspects of sexual intercourse. It promotes NFP as a way to responsibly plan families while remaining open to life and respecting the natural cycles of fertility.</p>

                    <p>Controversy: This stance conflicts with contemporary views on gender identity and transgender rights.</p>
                    <p>Catholic perspective: While affirming the dignity of all persons, including those experiencing gender dysphoria, the Church maintains that gender is not a social construct but is rooted in biological reality.

                <h3 class="topic-title">7. Divorce and Annulments in the Catholic Church</h3>

                    <p>Catholic teaching: The Church teaches that sacramental marriages are indissoluble but offers annulments in cases where a valid marriage never existed.</p>
                    <p>Controversy: This stance can be challenging in a society where divorce is common and remarriage is widely accepted.</p>
                    <p>Catholic perspective: While upholding the permanence of marriage, the Church recognizes that some marriages may have been invalid from the start due to various factors. Annulments declare such marriages null, allowing individuals to marry in the Church.</p>

                <div class="topic-content">
                    <p>Catholic teaching: The Church now teaches that the death penalty is inadmissible because it violates the dignity of the person.</p>
                    <p>Controversy: This represents a development in Church teaching and conflicts with policies in some countries that maintain capital punishment.</p>
                    <p>Catholic perspective: While the Church previously allowed for the death penalty in extremely rare cases, it now advocates for non-lethal means of protecting society and allowing for the possibility of redemption. This stance is based on evolving understanding of human dignity and the penal system.</p>
