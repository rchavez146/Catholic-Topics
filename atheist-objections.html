                <div class="topic-content">
                    <p>Catholic belief: God exists and can be known through reason and revelation.</p>
                    <p>Atheist objection: There's no empirical evidence for God's existence; belief in God is irrational.</p>
                    <p>Catholic response: While God isn't subject to direct empirical observation, His existence can be rationally inferred through philosophical arguments (e.g., Aquinas' Five Ways) and the evidence of order and design in the universe.</p>
                    <strong>Biblical Evidence:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Romans 1:20: "Ever since the creation of the world his eternal power and divine nature, invisible though they are, have been understood and seen through the things he has made."</li>
                        <li>Psalm 19:1: "The heavens are telling the glory of God; and the firmament proclaims his handiwork."</li>

                <div class="topic-content">
                    <p>Catholic belief: Faith and reason are complementary, not contradictory.</p>
                    <p>Atheist objection: Faith is belief without evidence and is incompatible with reason and scientific thinking.</p>
                    <p>Catholic response: Faith in Catholic understanding is not blind belief but a reasoned trust based on evidence and experience. Many great scientists throughout history have been people of faith, showing no inherent conflict between faith and reason.</p>
                    <strong>Biblical Evidence:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>1 Peter 3:15: "Always be ready to make your defense to anyone who demands from you an accounting for the hope that is in you."</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>CCC 159: "Faith and science: 'Though faith is above reason, there can never be any real discrepancy between faith and reason. Since the same God who reveals mysteries and infuses faith has bestowed the light of reason on the human mind, God cannot deny himself, nor can truth ever contradict truth.'"</li>

                <div class="topic-content">
                    <p>Catholic belief: God is all-good and all-powerful, yet evil exists due to the misuse of free will and as a consequence of a fallen world.</p>
                    <p>Atheist objection: The existence of evil and suffering is incompatible with an all-powerful, all-loving God.</p>
                    <p>Catholic response: Free will is a greater good that allows for the possibility of evil. Much suffering results from human choices. God can bring good out of evil, and the ultimate resolution to evil is found in Christ's redemptive work and the promise of eternal life.</p>
                    <strong>Biblical Evidence:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Romans 5:3-5: "And not only that, but we also boast in our sufferings, knowing that suffering produces endurance, and endurance produces character, and character produces hope, and hope does not disappoint us."</li>
                        <li>Genesis 50:20: "Even though you intended to do harm to me, God intended it for good."</li>

                        <li>CCC 310-314: Discusses the mystery of evil and God's permission of it.</li>

                <div class="topic-content">
                    <p>Catholic belief: Jesus physically rose from the dead, a historical event central to Christian faith.</p>
                    <p>Atheist objection: The resurrection is a myth or legend, not a historical event; there's no scientific evidence for someone rising from the dead.</p>
                    <p>Catholic response: The resurrection is supported by historical evidence: the empty tomb, post-resurrection appearances, the transformation of the disciples, and the rapid spread of Christianity despite persecution. While a supernatural event, it has historical implications that can be examined.</p>
                    <strong>Biblical Evidence:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>1 Corinthians 15:3-8: Paul provides an early creedal statement about Christ's death, burial, and appearances to various witnesses.</li>
                        <li>Acts 2:24, 32: Peter's sermon affirms the resurrection as a historical event.</li>

                        </li>
                        <li>CCC 640-644: Discusses the historical and transcendent character of the resurrection.</li>

                <div class="topic-content">
                    <p>Catholic belief: Objective moral values and duties point to the existence of God as their source.</p>
                    <p>Atheist objection: Morality is subjective and can be explained through evolution and social conditioning without invoking God.</p>
                    <p>Catholic response: While evolution can explain the development of moral behavior, it doesn't account for objective moral values. The universal sense of right and wrong, and the obligation to do good, suggest a transcendent source of morality, best explained by God.</p>
                    <strong>Biblical Evidence:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Romans 2:14-15: "When Gentiles, who do not possess the law, do instinctively what the law requires, these, though not having the law, are a law to themselves. They show that what the law requires is written on their hearts..."</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>CCC 1954: "The natural law is written and engraved in the soul of each and every man, because it is human reason ordaining him to do good and forbidding him to sin."</li>
                        <li>CCC 1955-1960: Discusses the universality and immutability of natural law.</li>

                <div class="topic-content">
                    <p>Catholic belief: The existence of contingent beings necessitates a necessary being (God) as their ultimate cause.</p>
                    <p>Atheist objection: The universe could be eternal or self-caused; there's no need for a divine first cause.</p>
                    <p>Catholic response: Even if the universe were eternal, it would still be contingent and require explanation for its existence. The argument from contingency points to a necessary being that is the ground of all existence, which we identify as God.</p>
                    <strong>Biblical Evidence:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Exodus 3:14: God identifies himself as "I AM WHO I AM," suggesting His necessary existence.</li>
                        <li>Colossians 1:17: "He himself is before all things, and in him all things hold together."</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>CCC 32: "The world: starting from movement, becoming, contingency, and the world's order and beauty, one can come to a knowledge of God as the origin and the end of the universe."</li>
                        <li>CCC 34: "The world, and man, attest that they contain within themselves neither their first principle nor their final end, but rather that they participate in Being itself, which alone is without origin or end."</li>

                <div class="topic-content">
                    <p>Catholic belief: Religion, particularly Christianity, has been a positive force in human society, promoting moral values, charity, and human dignity.</p>
                    <p>Atheist objection: Religion has been a source of conflict, oppression, and impediment to scientific progress.</p>
                    <p>Catholic response: While religion has been misused, it has also been a major force for good, inspiring art, philosophy, education, and charitable works. The Catholic Church has been a leading provider of healthcare, education, and social services worldwide.</p>
                    <strong>Biblical Evidence:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Matthew 25:35-36: "For I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me, I was naked and you gave me clothing, I was sick and you took care of me, I was in prison and you visited me."
                        </li>
                        <li>James 1:27: "Religion that is pure and undefiled before God, the Father, is this: to care for orphans and widows in their distress, and to keep oneself unstained by the world."</li>

                <div class="topic-content">
                    <p>Catholic belief: Miracles are possible and have occurred throughout history as signs of God's presence and power.</p>
                    <p>Atheist objection: Miracles violate natural laws and are scientifically impossible; claims of miracles are based on ignorance or deception.</p>
                    <p>Catholic response: Miracles don't violate natural laws but represent God's intervention in nature. Many miracles, like those at Lourdes, have been carefully documented and investigated, defying natural explanation. The scientific method cannot rule out the possibility of supernatural events.</p>
                    <strong>Biblical Evidence:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>John 10:38: "But if I do them, even though you do not believe me, believe the works, so that you may know and understand that the Father is in me and I am in the Father."</li>
                        <li>Acts 2:22: "You that are Israelites, listen to what I have to say: Jesus of Nazareth, a man attested to you by God with deeds of power, wonders, and signs that God did through him among you, as you yourselves know..."</li>

                <div class="topic-content">
                    <p>Catholic belief: God created the universe, though the Church is open to various scientific theories about how this occurred, including the Big Bang.</p>
                    <p>Atheist objection: The universe can be explained purely through natural processes; invoking God is unnecessary and unscientific.</p>
                    <p>Catholic response: The Big Bang theory, proposed by Catholic priest Georges Lemaître, is compatible with the idea of divine creation. The fine-tuning of cosmic constants suggests a designer. Science explains how the universe works, but faith addresses why it exists at all.</p>
                    <strong>Biblical Evidence:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Genesis 1:1: "In the beginning when God created the heavens and the earth."</li>
                        <li>Colossians 1:16-17: "For in him all things in heaven and on earth were created, things visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or powers—all things have been created through him and for him. He himself is before all things, and in him all things hold together."</li>
                    </ul>
                    <strong>Catechism of the Catholic Church (CCC):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>CCC 283: "The question about the origins of the world and of man has been the object of many scientific studies which have splendidly enriched our knowledge of the age and dimensions of the cosmos, the development of life-forms and the appearance of man. These discoveries invite us to even greater admiration for the greatness of the Creator, prompting us to give him thanks for all his works and for the understanding and wisdom he gives to scholars and researchers."</li>
                        <li>CCC 284: "The great interest accorded to these studies is strongly stimulated by a question of another order, which goes beyond the proper domain of the natural sciences. It is not only a question of knowing when and how the universe arose physically, or when man appeared, but rather of discovering the meaning of such an origin."</li>

                <div class="topic-content">
                    <p>Catholic belief: God is the source of moral truth, and religious faith provides a solid foundation for ethical behavior.</p>
                    <p>Atheist objection: Morality can exist without God; secular ethics based on reason and empathy are sufficient.</p>
                    <p>Catholic response: While atheists can be moral, belief in God provides a stronger foundation for objective morality and ultimate accountability. Catholic moral teaching, based on natural law, offers a comprehensive ethical framework that addresses complex moral issues.</p>
