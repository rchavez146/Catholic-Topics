                <h3 class="topic-title">1. The Existence of God</h3>
                <div class="topic-content">
                    <p>Catholic belief: God exists and can be known through reason and revelation.</p>
                    <p>Atheist objection: There's no empirical evidence for God's existence; belief in God is irrational.</p>
                    <p>Catholic response: While God isn't subject to direct empirical observation, His existence can be rationally inferred through philosophical arguments (e.g., Aquinas' Five Ways) and the evidence of order and design in the universe.</p>
                </div>

                <h3 class="topic-title">2. Faith and Reason</h3>
                <div class="topic-content">
                    <p>Catholic belief: Faith and reason are complementary, not contradictory.</p>
                    <p>Atheist objection: Faith is belief without evidence and is incompatible with reason and scientific thinking.</p>
                    <p>Catholic response: Faith in Catholic understanding is not blind belief but a reasoned trust based on evidence and experience. Many great scientists throughout history have been people of faith, showing no inherent conflict between faith and reason.</p>

            <div class="topic">
                <h3 class="topic-title">3. The Problem of Evil</h3>
                <div class="topic-content">
                    <p>Catholic belief: God is all-good and all-powerful, yet evil exists due to the misuse of free will and as a consequence of a fallen world.</p>
                    <p>Atheist objection: The existence of evil and suffering is incompatible with an all-powerful, all-loving God.</p>
                    <p>Catholic response: Free will is a greater good that allows for the possibility of evil. Much suffering results from human choices. God can bring good out of evil, and the ultimate resolution to evil is found in Christ's redemptive work and the promise of eternal life.</p>

            <div class="topic">
                <h3 class="topic-title">4. The Historicity of Jesus' Resurrection</h3>
                <div class="topic-content">
                    <p>Catholic belief: Jesus physically rose from the dead, a historical event central to Christian faith.</p>
                    <p>Atheist objection: The resurrection is a myth or legend, not a historical event; there's no scientific evidence for someone rising from the dead.</p>
                    <p>Catholic response: The resurrection is supported by historical evidence: the empty tomb, post-resurrection appearances, the transformation of the disciples, and the rapid spread of Christianity despite persecution. While a supernatural event, it has historical implications that can be examined.</p>

            <div class="topic">
                <h3 class="topic-title">5. The Moral Argument for God's Existence</h3>
                <div class="topic-content">
                    <p>Catholic belief: Objective moral values and duties point to the existence of God as their source.</p>
                    <p>Atheist objection: Morality is subjective and can be explained through evolution and social conditioning without invoking God.</p>
                    <p>Catholic response: While evolution can explain the development of moral behavior, it doesn't account for objective moral values. The universal sense of right and wrong, and the obligation to do good, suggest a transcendent source of morality, best explained by God.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="topic">
                <h3 class="topic-title">6. The Argument from Contingency</h3>
                <div class="topic-content">
                    <p>Catholic belief: The existence of contingent beings necessitates a necessary being (God) as their ultimate cause.</p>
                    <p>Atheist objection: The universe could be eternal or self-caused; there's no need for a divine first cause.</p>
                    <p>Catholic response: Even if the universe were eternal, it would still be contingent and require explanation for its existence. The argument from contingency points to a necessary being that is the ground of all existence, which we identify as God.</p>

            <div class="topic">
                <h3 class="topic-title">7. The Role of Religion in Human Society</h3>
                <div class="topic-content">
                    <p>Catholic belief: Religion, particularly Christianity, has been a positive force in human society, promoting moral values, charity, and human dignity.</p>
                    <p>Atheist objection: Religion has been a source of conflict, oppression, and impediment to scientific progress.</p>
                    <p>Catholic response: While religion has been misused, it has also been a major force for good, inspiring art, philosophy, education, and charitable works. The Catholic Church has been a leading provider of healthcare, education, and social services worldwide.</p>

            <div class="topic">
                <h3 class="topic-title">8. Miracles and the Supernatural</h3>
                <div class="topic-content">
                    <p>Catholic belief: Miracles are possible and have occurred throughout history as signs of God's presence and power.</p>
                    <p>Atheist objection: Miracles violate natural laws and are scientifically impossible; claims of miracles are based on ignorance or deception.</p>
                    <p>Catholic response: Miracles don't violate natural laws but represent God's intervention in nature. Many miracles, like those at Lourdes, have been carefully documented and investigated, defying natural explanation. The scientific method cannot rule out the possibility of supernatural events.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="topic">
                <h3 class="topic-title">9. The Origins of the Universe</h3>
                <div class="topic-content">
                    <p>Catholic belief: God created the universe, though the Church is open to various scientific theories about how this occurred, including the Big Bang.</p>
                    <p>Atheist objection: The universe can be explained purely through natural processes; invoking God is unnecessary and unscientific.</p>
                    <p>Catholic response: The Big Bang theory, proposed by Catholic priest Georges Lemaître, is compatible with the idea of divine creation. The fine-tuning of cosmic constants suggests a designer. Science explains how the universe works, but faith addresses why it exists at all.</p>

            <div class="topic">
                <h3 class="topic-title">10. The Role of Religion in Ethics</h3>
                <div class="topic-content">
                    <p>Catholic belief: God is the source of moral truth, and religious faith provides a solid foundation for ethical behavior.</p>
                    <p>Atheist objection: Morality can exist without God; secular ethics based on reason and empathy are sufficient.</p>
                    <p>Catholic response: While atheists can be moral, belief in God provides a stronger foundation for objective morality and ultimate accountability. Catholic moral teaching, based on natural law, offers a comprehensive ethical framework that addresses complex moral issues.</p>
