                <h3 class="topic-title">1. The Cosmological Argument</h3>
                <div class="topic-content">
                    <p>This argument posits that everything that exists has a cause, and since the universe exists, it must have a cause, which is God.</p>
                    <h4>Common Objection:</h4>
                    <p>If everything needs a cause, what caused God? This leads to an infinite regress.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="topic">
                <h3 class="topic-title">2. The Teleological Argument</h3>
                <div class="topic-content">
                    <p>Also known as the argument from design, it suggests that the complexity and apparent purpose in the universe imply a designer.</p>
                    <h4>Common Objection:</h4>
                    <p>Natural selection can explain complexity without a designer.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="topic">
                <h3 class="topic-title">3. The Ontological Argument</h3>
                <div class="topic-content">
                    <p>This argument claims that the very concept of God as a perfect being necessitates His existence, as existence is a perfection.</p>
                    <h4>Common Objection:</h4>
                    <p>Existence is not a property or predicate that can be attributed to a concept.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="topic">
                <h3 class="topic-title">4. The Moral Argument</h3>
                <div class="topic-content">
                    <p>This argument states that the existence of objective moral values implies the existence of God as their source.</p>
                    <h4>Common Objection:</h4>
                    <p>Moral values could be the result of evolutionary and social development, not requiring a divine source.</p>
                </div>

            <div class="topic">
                <h3 class="topic-title">5. The Argument from Religious Experience</h3>
                <div class="topic-content">
                    <p>This argument is based on the widespread occurrence of religious experiences across cultures and throughout history as evidence for God's existence.</p>
                    <h4>Common Objection:</h4>
                    <p>Religious experiences could be explained by psychological or neurological factors, not necessarily pointing to a divine reality.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="topic">
                <h3 class="topic-title">6. The Argument from Consciousness</h3>
                <div class="topic-content">
                    <p>This argument suggests that the existence of consciousness and self-awareness cannot be fully explained by materialistic processes and points to a divine source.</p>
                    <h4>Common Objection:</h4>
                    <p>Consciousness could be an emergent property of complex neurological systems, not requiring a supernatural explanation.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="topic">
                <h3 class="topic-title">7. The Argument from Reason</h3>
                <div class="topic-content">
                    <p>This argument contends that the human ability to reason and understand the universe implies a rational source behind the universe itself.</p>
                    <h4>Common Objection:</h4>
                    <p>Human reason could be a product of evolution, developed for survival, not necessarily implying a divine rational source.</p>
                </div>

            <div class="topic">
                <h3 class="topic-title">8. The Fine-Tuning Argument</h3>
                <div class="topic-content">
                    <p>This argument points to the precise calibration of physical constants in the universe that allow for life, suggesting a fine-tuner (God).</p>
                    <h4>Common Objection:</h4>
                    <p>The multiverse theory suggests that out of infinite universes, some would naturally have the right conditions for life.</p>
                </div>

            <div class="topic">
                <h3 class="topic-title">9. The Argument from Desire</h3>
                <div class="topic-content">
                    <p>This argument, popularized by C.S. Lewis, suggests that the human desire for something beyond the natural world points to the existence of that something (God).</p>
                    <h4>Common Objection:</h4>
                    <p>Desires don't necessarily imply the existence of their objects; humans can desire fictional or impossible things.</p>
                </div>

            <div class="topic">
                <h3 class="topic-title">10. The Transcendental Argument</h3>
                <div class="topic-content">
                    <p>This argument claims that logical absolutes, which are necessary for rational thought, can only be grounded in an absolute mind (God).</p>
                    <h4>Common Objection:</h4>
                    <p>Logical absolutes could be properties of reality itself, not requiring a divine mind to ground them.</p>
