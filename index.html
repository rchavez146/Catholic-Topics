                <div class="topic-content">
                    <p>Catholic belief: The Pope, as successor to St. Peter, has supreme authority in the Church and, under specific conditions, can make infallible declarations on faith and morals.</p>
                    <p>Protestant objection: This doctrine is not explicitly found in Scripture and seems to elevate human authority above God's Word.</p>
                    <p>Catholic response: The authority of the Pope is rooted in Matthew 16:18-19 and John 21:15-17. Papal infallibility is a charism to preserve the Church from error, not to introduce new doctrines.</p>

                <div class="topic-content">
                    <p>Catholic belief: Sacred Tradition, alongside Scripture, is a source of divine revelation and authoritative teaching.</p>
                    <p>Protestant objection: Sola Scriptura - Scripture alone is sufficient for all matters of faith and practice.</p>
                    <p>Catholic response: The Bible itself speaks of following traditions (2 Thessalonians 2:15). Tradition helps interpret Scripture and preserves teachings not explicitly written in the Bible but passed down from the apostles.</p>

                <div class="topic-content">
                    <p>Catholic belief: The Catholic Bible includes seven deuterocanonical books not found in most Protestant Bibles.</p>
                    <p>Protestant objection: These books are not inspired and were added later to the canon.</p>
                    <p>Catholic response: These books were part of the Septuagint used by early Christians and were officially recognized as canonical by the Church in the 4th century. They contain valuable spiritual teachings and historical information.</p>
                    <strong>Biblical Evidence:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The New Testament quotes or alludes to the deuterocanonical books multiple times, e.g., Hebrews 11:35 alludes to 2 Maccabees 7.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>CCC 120: "It was by the apostolic Tradition that the Church discerned which writings are to be included in the list of the sacred books.

                <div class="topic-content">
                    <p>Catholic belief: Mary plays a unique role in salvation history as the Mother of God and has special privileges such as her Immaculate Conception and Assumption.</p>
                    <p>Protestant objection: This seems to elevate Mary to a divine status and detracts from Christ's unique mediation.</p>
                    <p>Catholic response: Marian doctrines ultimately point to Christ. Mary's role is always in relation to and in service of her Son. Her privileges are by God's grace and highlight the power of Christ's redemption.</p>
                    <strong>Biblical Evidence:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Luke 1:28: The angel greets Mary as "full of grace," indicating her special status.</li>
                        <li>Luke 1:42: Elizabeth calls Mary "blessed among women" and "mother of my Lord."</li>

                        <li>CCC 487-511: Discusses Mary's role in the mystery of Christ.</li>
                        <li>CCC 966: "Finally the Immaculate Virgin, preserved free from all stain of original sin, when the course of her earthly life was finished, was taken up body and soul into heavenly glory, and exalted by the Lord as Queen over all things."</li>

                    <p>Catholic belief: The faithful on earth can pray for and to the saints in heaven, asking for their intercession.</p>
                    <p>Protestant objection: This practice seems to contradict the biblical teaching of Christ as the one mediator between God and man.</p>
                    <p>Catholic response: Asking saints for prayers is akin to asking fellow Christians on earth to pray for us. It doesn't replace Christ's unique mediation but is a way the Body of Christ works together.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Revelation 5:8: The saints in heaven offer the prayers of God's people to Him.</li>

                <div class="topic-content">
                    <p>Catholic belief: After death, those destined for heaven may undergo a process of purification called purgatory.</p>
                    <p>Protestant objection: This doctrine is not explicitly found in Scripture and seems to undermine the sufficiency of Christ's atonement.</p>
                    <p>Catholic response: Purgatory is implied in passages like 1 Corinthians 3:15 and is a process of final sanctification. It doesn't add to Christ's work but is how His saving work is applied to us.</p>

                    <p>Catholic response: The Bible shows whole households being baptized (Acts 16:15, 33). Infant baptism has been practiced since early Christianity and reflects God's prevenient grace and the covenantal nature of faith.</p>

                <div class="topic-content">
                    <p>Catholic belief: Confession to a priest is a sacrament instituted by Christ for the forgiveness of sins committed after baptism.</p>

                    <p>Catholic response: While we can and should confess directly to God, Jesus gave the Apostles (and their successors) the authority to forgive sins (John 20:23). The priest acts in persona Christi, providing pastoral care and assurance of forgiveness.</p>

                    <p>Catholic response: The Immaculate Conception is a preeminent application of Christ's saving work. It's prefigured in Luke 1:28 ("full of grace") and logically follows from Mary's role as the Mother of God.</p>

                    <p>Catholic response: Justification involves both a declaration of righteousness and an internal transformation. It's an ongoing process of growing in holiness, not just a legal status change.</p>
