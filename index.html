                <div class="topic-content">
                    <p>Catholic belief: The Pope, as successor to St. Peter, has supreme authority in the Church and, under specific conditions, can make infallible declarations on faith and morals.</p>
                    <p>Protestant objection: This doctrine is not explicitly found in Scripture and seems to elevate human authority above God's Word.</p>
                    <p>Catholic response: The authority of the Pope is rooted in Matthew 16:18-19 and John 21:15-17. Papal infallibility is a charism to preserve the Church from error, not to introduce new doctrines.</p>

                <h3 class="topic-title">2. The Role of Tradition in Catholic Theology</h3>
                <div class="topic-content">
                    <p>Catholic belief: Sacred Tradition, alongside Scripture, is a source of divine revelation and authoritative teaching.</p>
                    <p>Protestant objection: Sola Scriptura - Scripture alone is sufficient for all matters of faith and practice.</p>
                    <p>Catholic response: The Bible itself speaks of following traditions (2 Thessalonians 2:15). Tradition helps interpret Scripture and preserves teachings not explicitly written in the Bible but passed down from the apostles.</p>

            <div class="topic">
                <h3 class="topic-title">3. The Canon of Scripture</h3>
                <div class="topic-content">
                    <p>Catholic belief: The Catholic Bible includes seven deuterocanonical books not found in most Protestant Bibles.</p>
                    <p>Protestant objection: These books are not inspired and were added later to the canon.</p>
                    <p>Catholic response: These books were part of the Septuagint used by early Christians and were officially recognized as canonical by the Church in the 4th century. They contain valuable spiritual teachings and historical information.</p>

                <h3 class="topic-title">4. The Role of Mary in Salvation History</h3>
                <div class="topic-content">
                    <p>Catholic belief: Mary plays a unique role in salvation history as the Mother of God and has special privileges such as her Immaculate Conception and Assumption.</p>
                    <p>Protestant objection: This seems to elevate Mary to a divine status and detracts from Christ's unique mediation.</p>
                    <p>Catholic response: Marian doctrines ultimately point to Christ. Mary's role is always in relation to and in service of her Son. Her privileges are by God's grace and highlight the power of Christ's redemption.</p>

            <div class="topic">
                <h3 class="topic-title">5. The Communion of Saints</h3>
                <div class="topic-content">
                    <p>Catholic belief: The faithful on earth can pray for and to the saints in heaven, asking for their intercession.</p>
                    <p>Protestant objection: This practice seems to contradict the biblical teaching of Christ as the one mediator between God and man.</p>
                    <p>Catholic response: Asking saints for prayers is akin to asking fellow Christians on earth to pray for us. It doesn't replace Christ's unique mediation but is a way the Body of Christ works together.</p>

            <div class="topic">
                <h3 class="topic-title">6. The Doctrine of Purgatory</h3>
                <div class="topic-content">
                    <p>Catholic belief: After death, those destined for heaven may undergo a process of purification called purgatory.</p>
                    <p>Protestant objection: This doctrine is not explicitly found in Scripture and seems to undermine the sufficiency of Christ's atonement.</p>
                    <p>Catholic response: Purgatory is implied in passages like 1 Corinthians 3:15 and is a process of final sanctification. It doesn't add to Christ's work but is how His saving work is applied to us.</p>

            <div class="topic">
                <h3 class="topic-title">7. The Sacraments as Means of Grace</h3>
                <div class="topic-content">
                    <p>Catholic belief: The seven sacraments are efficacious signs of grace instituted by Christ to give sanctifying grace.</p>
                    <p>Protestant objection: Many Protestants view sacraments (or ordinances) as symbolic acts of obedience rather than means of receiving grace.</p>
                    <p>Catholic response: The sacraments are rooted in Scripture and early Church practice. They are physical means through which God's invisible grace is conveyed, reflecting the incarnational nature of Christianity.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="topic">
                <h3 class="topic-title">8. The Real Presence in the Eucharist</h3>
                <div class="topic-content">
                    <p>Catholic belief: In the Eucharist, the bread and wine truly become the Body and Blood of Christ (transubstantiation).</p>
                    <p>Protestant objection: This is often seen as a symbolic memorial of Christ's sacrifice rather than a literal change.</p>
                    <p>Catholic response: Jesus' words at the Last Supper and in John 6 support a literal interpretation. The Real Presence has been the consistent teaching of the Church from earliest times.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="topic">
                <h3 class="topic-title">9. The Role of Works in Salvation</h3>
                <div class="topic-content">
                    <p>Catholic belief: While salvation is by grace through faith, good works play a role in our justification and sanctification.</p>
                    <p>Protestant objection: Sola Fide - justification is by faith alone, and works are merely the fruit of salvation, not a means to it.</p>
                    <p>Catholic response: Faith and works are inseparable (James 2:14-26). Good works are a response to and cooperation with God's grace, not a means of earning salvation.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="topic">
                <h3 class="topic-title">10. Infant Baptism</h3>
                <div class="topic-content">
                    <p>Catholic belief: Infants should be baptized to remove original sin and incorporate them into the Church.</p>
                    <p>Protestant objection: Only believers should be baptized, as baptism requires personal faith and repentance.</p>
                    <p>Catholic response: The Bible shows whole households being baptized (Acts 16:15, 33). Infant baptism has been practiced since early Christianity and reflects God's prevenient grace and the covenantal nature of faith.</p>
                </div>

            <div class="topic">
                <h3 class="topic-title">11. The Role of Confession to a Priest</h3>
                <div class="topic-content">
                    <p>Catholic belief: Confession to a priest is a sacrament instituted by Christ for the forgiveness of sins committed after baptism.</p>
                    <p>Protestant objection: Confession should be made directly to God, not to a human intermediary.</p>
                    <p>Catholic response: While we can and should confess directly to God, Jesus gave the Apostles (and their successors) the authority to forgive sins (John 20:23). The priest acts in persona Christi, providing pastoral care and assurance of forgiveness.</p>

            <div class="topic">
                <h3 class="topic-title">12. The Immaculate Conception of Mary</h3>
                <div class="topic-content">
                    <p>Catholic belief: Mary was conceived without original sin and remained sinless throughout her life.</p>
                    <p>Protestant objection: This doctrine is not found in Scripture and seems to contradict the universal need for salvation through Christ.</p>
                    <p>Catholic response: The Immaculate Conception is a preeminent application of Christ's saving work. It's prefigured in Luke 1:28 ("full of grace") and logically follows from Mary's role as the Mother of God.</p>

                <div class="topic-content">
                    <p>Catholic belief: Mary remained a virgin before, during, and after the birth of Jesus.</p>
                    <p>Protestant objection: The Bible mentions Jesus' brothers and sisters, suggesting Mary had other children.</p>
                    <p>Catholic response: "Brothers" in Scripture can refer to extended relatives. Jesus entrusting Mary to John at the crucifixion suggests she had no other children. This doctrine has been held since the early Church.</p>

                <div class="topic-content">
                    <p>Catholic belief: At the end of her earthly life, Mary was assumed body and soul into heavenly glory.</p>
                    <p>Protestant objection: There is no biblical evidence for this belief.</p>
                    <p>Catholic response: While not explicitly in Scripture, the Assumption is a logical conclusion from Mary's sinlessness and her unique role in salvation history. It anticipates the resurrection promised to all believers.</p>

                <h3 class="topic-title">15. The Catholic Understanding of Justification</h3>
                <div class="topic-content">
                    <p>Catholic belief: Justification is a process by which one is made righteous, not just declared righteous.</p>
                    <p>Protestant objection: Justification is a one-time event where God declares the sinner righteous based on Christ's righteousness.</p>
                    <p>Catholic response: Justification involves both a declaration of righteousness and an internal transformation. It's an ongoing process of growing in holiness, not just a legal status change.</p>

                <h3 class="topic-title">16. The Sacrificial Nature of the Mass</h3>
                <div class="topic-content">
                    <p>Catholic belief: The Mass is a true sacrifice, re-presenting (not re-sacrificing) Christ's one sacrifice on Calvary.</p>
                    <p>Protestant objection: Christ's sacrifice was once for all and cannot be repeated or re-presented.</p>
                    <p>Catholic response: The Mass doesn't repeat Christ's sacrifice but makes it present in an unbloody manner. It fulfills Malachi 1:11's prophecy of a pure offering made in every place.</p>

                <div class="topic-content">
                    <p>Catholic belief: Relics and holy images can be venerated as a way of honoring the saints and God.</p>
                    <p>Protestant objection: This practice borders on idolatry and violates the biblical prohibition against graven images.</p>
                    <p>Catholic response: Veneration is distinct from worship, which is reserved for God alone. The use of images and relics has biblical precedent (e.g., the bronze serpent, healing through Paul's handkerchiefs) and helps engage our senses in worship.</p>

                <div class="topic-content">
                    <p>Catholic belief: The deuterocanonical books are inspired Scripture and part of the Old Testament canon.</p>
                    <p>Protestant objection: These books are not inspired and contain doctrinal and historical errors.</p>
                    <p>Catholic response: These books were part of the Septuagint used by the Apostles and early Church. They were universally accepted until the Reformation. They contain valuable teachings and historical information about the period between the Old and New Testaments.</p>

                <div class="topic-content">
                    <p>Catholic belief: The authority of the Church is passed down from the Apostles through an unbroken line of bishops.</p>
                    <p>Protestant objection: All believers are part of the priesthood of believers; no special priestly class is needed.</p>
                    <p>Catholic response: While all believers share in Christ's priesthood, Apostolic Succession ensures the continuity of Christ's mission and authority in the Church (Acts 1:20, 2 Timothy 2:2).</p>

                <div class="topic-content">
                    <p>Catholic belief: The Magisterium (teaching authority of the Church) authentically interprets God's Word in Scripture and Tradition.</p>
                    <p>Protestant objection: Individual believers, guided by the Holy Spirit, can interpret Scripture for themselves.</p>
                    <p>Catholic response: The Magisterium prevents doctrinal chaos and ensures unity in essential beliefs. It fulfills Christ's promise that the Spirit would guide the Church into all truth (John 16:13).</p>
