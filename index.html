                <div class="topic-content">
                    <p class="mb-4">The Pope, as the Bishop of Rome, is considered the successor of Saint Peter and the visible head of the Catholic Church. Papal infallibility is a dogma that states the Pope is preserved from the possibility of error when he solemnly declares or promulgates to the universal Church a dogmatic teaching on faith or morals.</p>

                    <p class="mb-4">The Eucharist is a central sacrament in Catholic worship. Transubstantiation is the doctrine that during consecration, the substance of the bread and wine changes into the body and blood of Christ, while the appearances remain the same.</p>

                        Response: Catholics distinguish between worship (latria) given to God alone and veneration (dulia) given to saints, with hyperdulia for Mary.</li>
                        <li><strong>Atheist perspective:</strong> "Why give such importance to Mary?"<br>
                        Response: Catholic beliefs about Mary are based on Scripture, early Christian traditions, and theological reasoning about her role as the Mother of God.</li>

                        <li><strong>Protestant perspective:</strong> "Why seven sacraments? The Bible only mentions Baptism and Communion."<br>
                        Response: Catholics derive the seven sacraments from Scripture and Tradition, believing they were all instituted by Christ and developed in the early Church.</li>
                        <li><strong>Atheist perspective:</strong> "Aren't these just symbolic rituals?"<br>

                    <p class="mb-4">Catholics believe salvation comes through Jesus Christ and involves both God's grace and human cooperation. Justification is seen as a process by which one becomes righteous in God's sight through faith and good works.</p>

                        Response: Catholics interpret passages about faith and works (like James 2:24) to mean that while salvation is a gift from God, our response in faith and works is necessary.</li>
                        <li><strong>Atheist perspective:</strong> "Why is salvation necessary?"<br>
                        Response: Catholics believe salvation addresses the fundamental human condition of sin and separation from God, offering reconciliation and eternal life.</li>

                        Response: Catholics believe this infallibility is limited to specific circumstances and is a divine protection, not a personal attribute of any individual.</li>
